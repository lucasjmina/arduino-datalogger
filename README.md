Enviroment variables are important for ecological studies because they affect the life cicle and
behaviour of organisms. Obtaining a trustworthy record of these variables require the use of
dataloggers, that can be quite expensive.  
Our objective is developing a datalogger more accesible and versatile than comercial available ones,
this could allow an increase in the data volume or making available a trustworthy way of recording
enviromental variables for small investigation groups.  
This repository corresponds to the first prototipe, codename "Oreo".
